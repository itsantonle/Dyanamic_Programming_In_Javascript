# First Note

this is solely for the purpose of understanding how recursive problems and flatmapping as well as hashmaps and stuffs for interviews and stuff. Feel free to look through my solutions, I should be able to add comments to each when I have more time

# Additional Note

I plan to rewrite all the recursive functions in Scala as well

# dependencies

```
npm install
```
