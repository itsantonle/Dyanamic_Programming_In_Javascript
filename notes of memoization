1. make the function recursive (find the base cases)
2. try to draw a tree of the nodes calling child functions
3. done making it recursive? Make it efficient
3. store tasks in a memo object
4. if two or more arguements concatenate into a key and store into memo
5 if it's already in the memo object JUST RETURN the value
6 else make a new memore property with the key and the value
7 return the value from inside the memo
